The Book of John  
The Gospel According to Religious Arts

---

Project Vision  
This is a cohesive cipher-based scripture album built around the Book of John using the King James Bible text. Each chapter is designed to flow with modular freestyles, structured hooks, and intentional commentary. The project builds narrative and theological continuity through recurring motifs and sonic transitions. It is not a collection of standalone tracks but a unified spiritual and musical journey.

---

Chapter Structure Template  
Each chapter follows this format:

HOOK  
A chapter-specific chorus that sets the tone and theme

CIPHER  
Freestyle scripture overlays formatted for clarity and flow

COMMENTARY  
Intentional Infinite drops that support the message with precision

BRIDGE  
New Testament and Old Testament overlay using the two plus one system only

OUTRO  
Echo verse, prayer, or fade to close the chapter

---

Recurring Motifs

“In the beginning was the Word”  
Used as a foundational anchor in Chapter 1

“Verily, verily”  
Used as an echo cue for emphasis and repetition

“I am” statements  
Used as thematic hooks in selected chapters such as John 6:35, John 8:12, John 10:11, John 11:25, John 14:6, and John 15:1

Word Library: Flagged Terms for Studio Clarity  
For use in narration, cipher overlays, and AI voice synthesis

---

defileth  
- Archaic “-eth” ending.  
- Pronounce as “defile-ith” with a soft “th” (like “with,” not “teeth”).  
- Common in Matthew 15 and John 15.  
- Tag for narration voice or phonetic cue.  
- Avoid cipher delivery unless stylized intentionally.

leaven  
- Often mispronounced or flattened in AI voice delivery.  
- Emphasize first syllable: “LEV-en.”  
- Appears in parables and doctrinal warnings.  
- Tag for clarity in cipher or overlay.  
- Consider commentary drop when used metaphorically.

---

Studio Strategy for Flagged Terms

- Assign narration voice for archaic or sensitive phrasing.  
- Use phonetic cues in scripts (e.g., “defile-ith”) to guide AI voice tools.  
- In CapCut overlays, you may modernize the text while keeping KJB audio intact.  
- Avoid spontaneous cipher use of flagged terms unless the flow supports it.  
- Infinite commentary should only highlight these words when contextually relevant.

---

Formatting Logic

- All flagged terms are tracked in this library for consistency.  
- Cue sheets will include a “Flagged Word” column for each chapter.  
- Words may be tagged as:  
  - Narration Only  
  - Phonetic Cue Required  
  - Commentary Eligible  
  - Overlay Sensitive

[ Narration 1: Ambient echo, Soft spoken ]  
In the beginning God created  
The heaven and the earth  
*  

[ Chorus 1: Unified voice, Ambient chant ]  
In the beginning was the Word  
And the Word was with God  
And the Word was God  
The same was in the beginning with God  
All things were made by him  
And without him was not any thing made that was made  
In him was life  
And the life was the light of men  
And the light shineth in darkness  
And the darkness comprehended it not  
*  

[ Narration 2: Deep voice, Bass hum ]  
There was a man sent from God  
Whose name was John  
*  

[ V1: Raw flow, Drums kick in, Theatrical swell ]  
The same came for a witness  
To bear witness of the Light  
That all men through him might believe  
He was not that Light  
But was sent to bear witness of that Light  
That was the true Light  
Which lighteth every man  
That cometh into the world  
He was in the world  
And the world was made by him  
And the world knew him not  
He came unto his own  
And his own received him not  
But as many as received him  
To them gave he power  
To become the sons of God  
Even to them that believe on his name  
Which were born, not of blood  
Nor of the will of the flesh  
Nor of the will of man  
But of God  
And the Word was made flesh  
And dwelt among us  
And we beheld his glory  
The glory as of the only begotten of the Father  
Full of grace and truth  
*  

[ Course 1 ]  

[ Narration 3: Infinite voice, Echo chamber ]  
John bare witness of him, and cried, saying,  
*  

[ V2: Cipher voice, Minimal percussion ]  
This was he of whom I spake  
He that cometh after me is preferred before me  
For he was before me  
And of his fulness have all we received  
And grace for grace  
For the law was given by Moses  
But grace and truth came by Jesus Christ  
No man hath seen God at any time  
The only begotten Son  
Which is in the bosom of the Father  
He hath declared him  
*  

[ Course 1 ]  

[ Narration 4: Infinite voice, Echo chamber ]  
And this is the record of John  
When the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him  
Who art thou?  
And he confessed  
*  

[ V3: Cipher voice, Raw cadence, Mid-tempo percussion ]  
And denied not  
But confessed, I am not the Christ  
And they asked him, What then?  
Art thou Elias?  
And he saith, I am not  
Art thou that prophet?  
And he answered, No  
Then said they unto him  
Who art thou?  
That we may give an answer to them that sent us  
What sayest thou of thyself?  
He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness  
Make straight the way of the Lord  
As said the prophet Esaias
