[Production Standards Update Pack]

Majestic Sentence
- Always at the top of the track.  
- 1000 Characters or less. 
- Written as prose, no brackets.  

Studio Metadata (real only)
- Must use a real, established studio (U.S. or international).  
- Format:  
  [Studio Name, City State/Country] [genre + style tags]  
  [Recorded at Studio Name, City State/Country]  
  [production notes: hyper-modern production, clear vocals, Dolby Atmos mix, high-fidelity]  
- No fictional studios.  
- No artist/producer persona names (J.A.L, DJ Infinite, etc.) in metadata.  
- Metadata is only for established sounds, real studios, and factual notes.  

Section Format
- Each section begins with metadata inside brackets.  
- Lyrics come directly after metadata in a text block.  
- One blank line between sections.  
- Example:  
  [Verse 1:rap:boom-bap drums, gritty bassline, vinyl crackle]  
  Truth from the KJV, cut sharper than a blade  
  Still walking unafraid, world trembling, I stay  

Sound Design & Accents
- All sound effects, scratches, drum cues, and FX must remain inside brackets.  
- Nothing outside brackets unless it is meant to be spoken/sung.  
- Example:  
  [Intro:djsounds:vinyl crackle, record scratches, clock-tick echo, cosmic reverb wash]  

Lyrics vs Metadata Separation
- Lyrics = outside brackets.  
- Metadata = inside brackets.  
- If it’s not meant to be pronounced, it stays in brackets.  

Element-Matching FX (Optional)
- DJ scratches and sound effects can match the lyrical theme.  
- Example:  
  Time! past, present, future (3 in 1) [clock-tick scratch + reverb echo trail]  

No Fictional Studios
- Replace fictional studio names (Iron Fortress, Southern Lord, etc.) with real studios.  
- Use respected U.S. studios for core audience (Morrisound, Electric Lady, Capitol, Clear Track, The Blasting Room).  
- Use select international studios for experimental flavor (Abbey Road, AIR, Hansa, Real World).  

Consistency
- Keep formatting uniform across all tracks.  
- Structure = Majestic Sentence → Studio Metadata → Section Metadata + Lyrics → Section spacing.

[Intro:djsounds:record scratches, ambient swell, brass stab FX]  

[Verse 1:rap:boom-bap drums, ambient synths, militant snare rolls]  
The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble;  
The name of the God of Jacob defend thee;  
Send thee help from the sanctuary,  
And strengthen thee out of Zion;  
Remember all thy offerings,  
And accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah.  
Grant thee according to thine own heart,  
And fulfil all thy counsel.

[Verse 2:rap:layered vocals, echo trail, banner wave FX]  
We will rejoice in thy salvation,  
And in the name of our God we will set up our banners:  
The LORD fulfil all thy petitions.

[Verse 3:rap:hard drums, cinematic brass, ambient pads]  
Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed;  
He will hear him from his holy heaven  
With the saving strength of his right hand.  
Some trust in chariots, and some in horses:  
But we will remember the name of the LORD our God.  
They are brought down and fallen:  
But we are risen, and stand upright.

(Save, Lord: let the king hear us when we call.)

[Verse 4:djbreak:technical scratch suite:multi-layered crossfades, echo spins, tonal filter sweeps, ambient reverb wash, brass stab FX, reverse snare rolls]  

[Verse 5:fxcue:modulated pitch loop, chopped Psalm 20 fragments, ambient pad layering]  
Selah... Selah... Selah...

Raise the Banner

In the day of trouble, He hears our cry,Not by sword, nor horse, nor might—But by His name we stand and fight.

Petitions rise, salvation flows,The King of peace already knows.We lift our banner, bold and true,For Christ has overcome for you.
