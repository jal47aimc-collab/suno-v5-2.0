# Master Prompt / LLM Reference  
_Unified Guide for Scripture-Based Music Generation with Suno AI_

---

## Introduction

The convergence of scripture-based music generation, advanced voice modeling, and metadata-driven control in Suno AI establishes new creative paradigms for faith-inspired audio experiences. This **Master Prompt / LLM Reference** weaves together three core pillars: (1) the GoofBah Voice DNA & Persona System, defining modular robotic DJ character logic and persona mapping; (2) the Voice Type & Chant Delivery Guide, documenting modular chant delivery and 18 distinct scripture-focused voice types; and (3) the Suno AI Scripture Music System Overview, which codifies system logic, metadata libraries, formatting norms, and stylebox standards.

This master document is structured for maximum clarity, modularity, and prompt engineering usability. Sectioned into detailed reference and application chapters, it ensures any Large Language Model (LLM) or prompt engineer has authoritative, flexible, and practical guidance to maximize Suno AI’s capabilities for faith-based audio generation. The following unified reference merges technical foundations, modular building blocks, and creative best practices for next-level scripture-to-music workflows.

## GoofBah Voice DNA & Persona System

### 1. The Philosophy of GoofBah Voice DNA

**GoofBah Voice DNA** represents an extensible, modular framework to define the unique vocal "genomes" and persona logic driving robotic DJ characters in scripture-based generative music contexts. At its core, Voice DNA encodes:

- **Foundational vocal characteristics** (pitch, timbre, resonance, formant patterns)
- **Persona-specific speech styles and microexpressions** (delivery quirks, inflections)
- **Modular attitude/energy overlays** (e.g., solemn, celebratory, didactic, soothing)
- **Cultural or symbolic references** relevant to spiritual or educational engagement

This layered encoding enables context-aware vocal personalization, supporting both schematic prompt engineering and seamless interoperability across chant delivery and music generation modules.

The GoofBah system is intentionally **modular** and **extensible**:
- **Base DNA** can be layered with one or more persona overlays
- Voice DNA blocks can be re-parameterized for different genres, delivery types, or spiritual traditions

In essence, GoofBah’s DNA system provides a structured, algorithmic basis for the “identity” of robotic DJ hosts in the system.

### 2. DJ Character and Persona Taxonomy

#### 2.1. DJ Archetypes and Metapersonas

Core DJ characters ("GoofBah hosts") are built on a taxonomy of **archetypes**, each with customizable persona subtypes. A standard taxonomy includes:

| Archetype          | Description                                    | Example Attributes             |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Solemn Guide       | Low-key, reverent, traditional                 | Deep resonance, measured pace |
| Jubilant Jester    | Upbeat, playful, celebratory                   | Rapid inflections, bright timbre |
| Meditative Sage    | Calm, introspective, hypnotic                   | Airy, breathy, extended vowels |
| Didactic Instructor| Authoritative, clear, motivational              | Crisp diction, defined rhythm |
| Cyber Chanter      | Extra-synthetic, glitch, AI-self-aware          | Robotic, formant distortion   |
| Community Chorus   | Group-voiced, inclusive, participatory          | Layered, ensemble textures    |

**Metapersonas** blend multiple archetypes; for example, "Techno Psalmist" could synthesize Meditative Sage and Cyber Chanter.

#### 2.2. Persona System Implementation

Each persona is implemented as:
- A unique **parameter set** (vocal registers, cadence matrix, expression maps)
- Prompt-aligned **style tokens** for Suno AI: e.g., `[Vocal Style: Jubilant Jester]`
- Behavioral "micro-rules" for delivery—intonation, implied gestures, rhythmic quotations

At the level of prompt engineering, the persona system serves as a flexible drop-in module, invoked via Suno AI’s Persona or Vocal Style tags.

---

### 3. Suno AI Personas Implementation and Best Practices

Suno AI's Personas are a major leap for consistent, identity-driven vocal performance. With Personas, creators can:

- Store and recall the **essence** (voice, style, vibe) of a generated track as a modular asset
- Apply the same persona across new tracks for consistent vocal identity
- Share personas publicly or keep them private for exclusive brand voice control

**Creating and Using a Persona in Suno AI:**
1. Identify a track whose vocal style matches your intent.
2. Use the Suno Personas tool to extract and name the persona, optionally assign an avatar and description.
3. Apply the persona to future text prompts—its vocal characteristics and vibe will be reused, regardless of new musical or lyrical content.
4. Pair with `[Vocal Style: X]` meta tags for additional fine-tuning.

**Best Practices:**
- Document persona traits extensively in your stylebox/checklists for reuse.
- Re-test personas in varied music styles for robustness.

---

### 4. Modular Persona and Voice DNA Layering

The GoofBah approach allows multi-layer persona logic:

- **Primary Persona (Core):** e.g., "Meditative Sage"
- **Attitude Overlay:** e.g., "Jubilant"
- **Delivery Mode Modifier:** e.g., "Whispered", "Stentorian"
- **Function Tag:** e.g., "[Vocal Style: Jubilant Whispered Sage]"

LLMs should compose prompts with modular persona stacks to maximize output diversity while retaining consistent vocal identity.

**Implementation Example:**
```
[Persona: Meditative Sage][Attitude: Jubilant][Delivery: Whispered][Function: Guide]
"[Verse] Behold, wisdom springs eternal..."
```

Suno AI and LLM pipelines should support this parameter stacking for versatile prompt engineering and reproducibility.

---

### 5. Persona Library Naming and Metadata Standards

All persona definitions should be:

- Cataloged with **unique, human-readable slugs**
- Documented with metadata fields:
    - Name, Short Description
    - Voice DNA Parameter Set (major values)
    - Usage Examples (links to tracks)
    - Creator/Owner (if public)
    - Version/Update history

This allows programmatic lookups, persona versioning, and cross-LMM referencing in long-term creative pipelines.

## Voice Type & Chant Delivery Guide

### 1. Overview: Modular Voice Types for Scripture Cipher Delivery

This section provides a **catalog of 18 modular voice types** essential for scripture cipher delivery in music generation with Suno AI. Each type is matched with fitting scriptural, spiritual, or liturgical use cases. Voice types are independent from persona overlays; both can be stacked for fine-grained prompt control.

---

### 2. The 18 Canonical Voice Types

Below is the authoritative list and their defining attributes:

| Voice Type Name      | Key Characteristics                                  | Example Application                               |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|

**Modular usage**: Voice type can be layered with any persona and/or delivery mode for robust stylistic flexibility.

---

### 3. Chant Delivery Patterns: Syntax and Prompt Engineering

Each voice type can be invoked with prompt-level meta tags for precise generative control:

**Examples:**
- `[Vocal Style: Chant] [Mood: Introspective] [Delivery: Monotone]`
- `[Vocal Style: Responsorial] [Structure: Call-and-Response]`
- `[Vocal Style: Deep Bass Drone][Energy: Monumental]`

**Detailed Prompt Engineering Guidance:**
- Place meta tags on the first or top lines of the Suno AI custom lyrics prompts (see Meta Tag Libraries below).
- Vocals stack with sections: e.g., `[Chorus][Vocal Style: Polyphonic Hymn]`
- Delivery cues can be combined with persona and energy tags for further nuance.

**Automatic crosswalk table** (matching scripture literary genres to ideal voice types) should be maintained for LLM reference.

---

### 4. Sample Modular Chant Delivery Prompts

**Scenario: Psalm 23 Recitation (Calm, Reverent Tone)**
```
[mode: spoken]
[voice: calm, gentle, reverent tone]
[pacing: slow, deliberate]
[pause after each verse]
[background music: soft, low, ambient guitar or pad]
[delivery: chant]
"The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. [pause]
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures..."
```

**Scenario: Communal Responsorial Psalm**
```
[Structure: Responsorial][Vocal Style: Call-and-Response][Mood: Joyful]
LEADER: "Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good."
ALL: "His love endures forever."
...
```

**Tips:**
- Vary vocal style, mood, and background cues for different emotional or liturgical outcomes.
- For rhythmic or pop-inflected chants, layer `[Vocal Style: Homophonic Pop][Energy: Upbeat]`.

**Elaboration:**  
Modular voice type and chant specification enable reproducibility and stylistic exploration. Scriptural delivery—whether ancient or contemporary—can thus be mapped directly onto vocal/metadata controls and rapid Suno AI deployment.

---

### 5. Combining Voice Types and Personas for Maximum Expressiveness

Consider the following extension for nuanced delivery:
- `[Persona: Jubilant Jester][Vocal Type: Call-and-Response][Mood: Celebratory][Energy: High]`
- `[Persona: Meditative Sage][Vocal Type: Drone][Mood: Introspective][Energy: Low]`

The system thus supports “voice DNA + persona + chant structure + meta/data overlays” for LLM combinatorial creativity.

## Suno AI Scripture Music System Overview

### 1. System Architecture and Core Logic

**System architecture** orchestrates the interplay between user input, modular voice/persona selection, meta tag libraries, formatting rules, and musical style generation. Key stages:

1. **Text Input**
    - User/scripture/verse selected, often chunked by semantic or liturgical section
2. **Persona/VoiceType Layering**
    - From GoofBah taxonomy and the 18 modular voice types
3. **Insertion of Meta Tags and Music Structure**
    - e.g., `[Intro][Mood: Uplifting][Vocal Style: Whisper][Instrument: Guitar, Pad]`
4. **Stylebox and Formatting Logic**
    - Format aligns with Suno AI’s expectations for maximal control and reproducibility
5. **Music Generation**
    - Suno AI interprets input signal, generates audio output with metadata embedded or attached
6. **Metadata Export/Update**
    - For tracking, distribution, and programmatic reuse

This pipeline enables prompt engineering at every stage for maximum creative and technical flexibility.

---

### 2. Formatting Logic: Prompt Construction, Meta Tag Libraries & System Syntax

#### 2.1. Meta Tag Syntax and Section Mapping

Meta tags, formatted in Suno-style square brackets, influence the output at both the structural and stylistic levels.

- **Structure Tags:** `[Intro]`, `[Verse]`, `[Chorus]`, `[Bridge]`, `[Drop]`, `[Outro]`
    - Map to distinct musical or narrative sections
    - Provide strong control when placed at the top of a prompt or just before relevant lyrics
- **Mood/Energy Tags:** `[Mood: Uplifting]`, `[Energy: Low]`
    - Direct the emotional contour of the generated music
- **Instrumentation Tags:** `[Instrument: Warm Rhodes, Synth]`, `[Instrument: Drums (Heavy)]`
    - Suggest instrument palette or sonic focus
- **Vocal/Persona Tags:** `[Vocal Style: Whisper]`, `[Vocal Effect: Reverb]`, `[Vocal Style: Community Chorus]`, `[Persona: GoofBah]`
    - Specify voice character or persona, critical for scripture-based content
- **Additional Tags:** `[Texture: Tape-Saturated]`, `[Callback: continue with same vibe as chorus]`, `[Structure: seamless loop]`

**Placement Matters:** The first 3-5 lines of a prompt carry the most weight. Prompt structuring and sequence highly affect Suno’s parsing.

#### 2.2. Stylebox Formatting Standards

Suno AI “stylebox” is the set of tags, tokens, and phraseologies defining distinctive musical and metadata behaviors for a project.

**Stylebox elements:**
- Structural mapping conventions
- Meta tag taxonomy and scope (limit to 1–2 genres, 1 mood, and a few key instruments for stability)
- Persona/voice/cipher overlays
- Consistent capitalization and section ordering
- Specific callback and looping conventions (“loop-friendly”)

Best results are achieved through stylebox documentation, ensuring prompt-to-prompt consistency and enabling rapid adaptation to future AI engine versions.

---

### 3. Metadata Libraries and Evolution

#### 3.1. Suno Meta Tag Evolution: V3 ➔ V4.5 ➔ V5

| Version        | Tag Strength         | Section Handling         | Emotion Parsing      | Persona Consistency    |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| V3             | Hints only          | Weak section mapping    | Vague                | Inconsistent           |
| V4.5           | Soft control tokens | Partial section support | Moderate             | Occasional drift       |
| V5 (Current)   | Studio-aware        | Predictable, reliable   | Precise, clear       | Robust across sections |

Versioning is essential; ensure all prompts and metadata are version-tagged for reproducibility.

#### 3.2. Metadata Field Categories

- **Song Structure**: `[Intro]`, `[Chorus]`, etc.—defining musical map
- **Vocal Metadata**: `[Vocalist: Female][Vocal Effect: Delay][Vocal Style: GoofBah Persona]`
- **Mood/Energy**: `[Mood: Melancholic][Energy: High]`
- **Instrument/Production**: `[Instrument: Drums (Heavy)][Texture: Tape-Saturated]`
- **Genre/Style**: `[Genre: Gospel][Style: Lo-fi][Era: 2000s]`

All metadata should be **cataloged in a central library** and used as a controlled vocabulary for scripting and prompt engineering. Maintain update logs for cross-platform or multi-engine workflows.

---

### 4. Suno AI Personas Feature Documentation

#### 4.1. Persona Creation and Reuse

- Personas capture all essential vocal/vibe information from a song and persist them for future use.
- **Workflow:**  
    - Select track → “Create Persona” → Assign name, image, and descriptive metadata → Save (public or private)
    - Apply to new tracks via Persona selection + lyrics/style prompts
- **Security:** Personas can be public (shareable library) or private (personal/brand voice consistency)

#### 4.2. Consistency and Credit

- Applying the same persona yields **consistent vocal character**, regardless of new music/lyrics.
- For scripture-based systems, always create Personas for each modular voice type or DJ archetype needed.

**Caveats:**  
- Persona fidelity and cross-track similarity can vary, especially with highly stylized or experimental tracks; ongoing persona testing is recommended.

#### 4.3. Versioning and Co-Creation

- As the Personas system matures, maintain version and changelog logs, and explore co-creation or remixing workflows involving multiple creators.

---

### 5. Prompt Engineering: LLM Strategy and Metadata Control

#### 5.1. Markdown Prompt Reference Guide

All system prompts, templates, and documentation are to be **written in Markdown** with:

- Logical, descriptive headers (`#`, `##`, `###`)
- 4–8 sentence, well-developed paragraphs per idea
- Tables for metrics or variant comparisons, with full paragraph elaborations after each
- Strategic but minimal use of **bold** for key takeaways or crucial terms
- Inline meta tags and [bracket] syntax for all Suno and metadata controls

**Example:**
```
## Psalm Chant (Monotone, Reverent)

[Intonation: Monotone][Vocal Style: Chant][Mood: Reverent][Instrument: Pipe Organ]
"Psalm 121. I lift up my eyes to the hills—where does my help come from? ..."
```

#### 5.2. LLM Prompt Engineering Tactics

- **System Role Prompting:** Always set the LLM’s context at the start (e.g., “You are a scripture DJ in the GoofBah system...”)
- **Role and Persona Layering:** Use persona/voice stack parameters as modular building blocks in the prompt’s front matter
- **Contextual Metadata Embedding:** Direct the LLM to embed all key meta tags, stylebox, and data fields as per Suno’s expectations
- **Content Validation:** Enforce markdown and meta tag standards to prevent misparsing by downstream Suno interfaces
- **Version and Feedback Hooks:** Embed version, creator, and feedback tokens for robust tracking (esp. if notebooks or backend prompt tracing is used)

**LLMs should be supplied with this guide as an input reference each session to maximize creative and metadata precision.**

---

### 6. Advanced Metadata & AI Music Standards (Industry Context)

With AI-generated spiritual music proliferating, global metadata standards have become essential:

- **ISRC-AAM-CID**: New identifier proposals embed AI participation levels and blockchain IDs for provenance
- **Metadata Transparency:** Fields clarify human vs. AI creation, weighting, and roles (songwriter, producer, performer)
- **Royalty & Attribution:** Metadata fields impact royalty payments, track attribution, and role recognition in mixed-author music

**Implications for Suno AI-based systems:**
- Metadata libraries should plan for compliance with evolving standards: AI participation scores, persona/voice creator tags, and relevant ISRC compatibility.

---

### 7. Example System Use Cases: End-to-End Script

#### **Use Case 1: Audio Devotional Psalm**  
- User selects Psalm 121 with intended “reverent chant” delivery
- LLM retrieves GoofBah “Solemn Guide” persona and `[Vocal Style: Chant]` template
- LLM constructs prompt:
    ```
    [Intro][Mood: Introspective][Vocal Style: Chant][Persona: Solemn Guide][Instrument: Pipe Organ]
    [Verse] I lift up my eyes to the hills—where does my help come from?
    [Chorus] My help comes from the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth.
    ```
- Metadata library auto-inserts catalog fields:
    - Source: Psalm 121 NIV
    - Persona: GoofBah_Solemn_Guide_v1
    - VoiceType: Chant
    - Structure: Verse/Chorus, Introspective mood
    - Stylebox: Pipe organ, minimal FX

#### **Use Case 2: Youth Group Call-and-Response Track**  
- Prompt:  
    ```
    [Intro][Mood: Uplifting][Energy: High][Vocal Style: Call-and-Response][Persona: Jubilant Jester][Instrument: Drums, Claps]
    [Leader] Who will climb the mountain of the Lord?
    [All] We will climb, we will praise!
    ```
- Result: Upbeat, modern, crowd-friendly scripture chant for group settings

#### **Use Case 3: Meditative Gospel Lo-Fi**  
- Prompt:  
    ```
    [Intro][Genre: Lo-fi][Mood: Peaceful][Instrument: Warm Rhodes, Vinyl Crackle][Vocal Style: Sprechgesang][Persona: Meditative Sage]
    “His peace covers me like a blanket in the night...”
    ```
- Yield: Looped, calming AI music suitable for meditation apps or personal devotion

### 8. Table: Cross-Reference—Scripture Genre to Voice Type/Persona

| Scripture Genre        | Recommended Voice Type                | Matching Persona(s)   |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Psalms (poetic, heartfelt)    | Chant, Responsorial, Sprechgesang    | Solemn Guide, Meditative Sage |
| Proverbial (wise, didactic)   | Spoken Word, Didactic Instructor     | Didactic Instructor      |
| Gospel Narrative (story, parable) | Recitative, Call-and-Response          | Community Chorus, Jubilant Jester |
| Prophetic (dramatic)      | Cantillation, Cantor Solo               | Cyber Chanter, Solemn Guide |
| Prayer/Lamentation        | Whispered Word, Deep Bass Drone         | Meditative Sage, Solemn Guide |
| Celebration/Thanksgiving  | Polyphonic Hymn, Layered Harmony        | Jubilant Jester, Cyber Chanter |

**Paragraph Analysis:**  
This table provides content engineers a rapid lookup to select the most natural voice and persona pairings for scripture genre, helping maximize emotional resonance and liturgical fit in Suno AI-based generative music. For example, psalms often benefit from chant-based, introspective GoofBah personas, whereas gospel narratives excel with animated, call-and-response delivery. In practical workflows, these crosswalks can be implemented as LLM prompt templates or procedural suggestion scripts within the guidance UI.

### Understanding Desired Output 1.0

#### Overview
This document records how we produced the first song for John Chapter One, the decisions we locked in, the mistakes that occurred during the process, and how each was resolved. It is written for the project owner and future collaborators to read and extend. This is a living document and will be updated with future changes or attachments.

---

### Final Deliverable Summary
- **Product:** First song for John Chapter One, ready for V5 generation and studio cue integration.  
- **Structure:** narration, hook, narration, v1, hook, narration, v2, v3, v4.  
- **Labeling standard:** lowercase section tags (v1, v2, v3, v4).  
- **Sonic Meditator rules:** 90s underground triggers, music theory cues, sound design elements; explicitly **no tape hiss** and **no vinyl crackle** unless added manually later.  
- **Bar awareness:** sections target 8–16 bars with hooks optimized for 4–8 bar loops.  
- **Persona style box:** concise V5 persona describing atmosphere, flow types, DJ scratch solos, and flexible structure.

---

### Workflow Log and Key Decisions
1. **Initial build**
   - Created a full-chapter cipher scaffold from John 1:1 onward.
   - Mapped scripture lines to modular verse sections and narration hooks.

2. **Labeling correction**
   - Mistake: a section was labeled `Verse2` instead of `v2`.  
   - Fix: standardized all labels to lowercase `v1`, `v2`, etc., and applied across document.

3. **Section boundary adjustments**
   - Mistake: v2 originally stopped short of verse 18 and incorrectly included verse 19.  
   - Fix: moved v2 endpoint to end of John 1:18; created v3 to start at John 1:19 and continue through 1:23; v4 starts at 1:24 through 1:28.

4. **Sonic Meditator refinement**
   - Initial additions included tape hiss and vinyl crackle.  
   - Project preference: these elements must not be embedded automatically.  
   - Fix: removed tape hiss and vinyl crackle from all sonic descriptors; documented rule that Jacob will add them manually if desired.

5. **Persona and terminology edits**
   - Iterative pruning of overly specific musical terms that would lock the project into rigid production patterns.  
   - Removed references to Mixolydian, parallel fifths, and explicit polyrhythmic claims where they limited flexibility.  
   - Final persona emphasizes gritty 90s textures, chant-based hooks, scripture-driven rap flows, DJ scratch solos, and a flexible structure blending narration, hooks, and verses.

6. **Bar research and rhythm audit**
   - Completed bar structure analysis: most sections land between 8–16 bars; hooks 4–8 bars.  
   - Decision: keep sections modular and bar-aware but avoid forcing exact theoretical constraints that block performance variations.

---

### Mistakes and How They Were Fixed
- **Labeling inconsistency**
  - Impact: potential misrouting in cue sheets and generation presets.  
  - Resolution: standardized lowercase labels and updated all references.

- **Incorrect verse splits**
  - Impact: lyrical continuity and section transitions were misaligned with scripture verses.  
  - Resolution: reassigned verse endpoints to match scripture: v2 ends at 1:18, v3 starts at 1:19 and ends at 1:23, v4 covers 1:24–1:28.

- **Unwanted sonic artifacts inserted**
  - Impact: produced textures outside preferred sound palette.  
  - Resolution: locked in exclusion rule for tape hiss and vinyl crackle; updated sonic descriptors to exclude these.

- **Overly prescriptive musical language**
  - Impact: would limit future generations and make the persona too rigid.  
  - Resolution: removed specific mode and contrapuntal references; replaced with general descriptors that preserve aesthetic without hard constraints.

### Sonic Sound Description Meditator Rules
- **Always include:** era reference (early 90s underground), texture descriptors (gritty melodic textures, analog warmth), performance cues (chant-based hooks, scripture-driven rap flows), DJ elements (scratch solos, syncopated turntable motifs), production touchpoints (thick bass, gritty snares, harmonic layering, dissonant intervals, chromatic inflections, atonal clusters).  
- **Never include by default:** tape hiss; vinyl crackle.  
- **Keep flexible:** do not lock in specific modes, intervals, or exact contrapuntal constructs. Use general music-theory-informed language only when it aids mood or generation, not as enforcement.

---

### Bar and Cue Sheet Guidelines
- **Target bars per section:** narration 2–4 lines; hooks 4–8 bars; verses 8–16 bars.  
- **Delivery allowance:** allow performers to extend or compress lines for breath control and expressive timing; maintain bar-aware metadata to enable looping and remixing.  
- **Cue labels:** use exact bracketed descriptors at section heads with sonic meditator shorthand for quick parsing in V5 metadata. Example:  
  - [v2: Freestyle cadence — Mid-tempo boom bap with analog warmth, minor key pad, layered vocal stack]

### Attachments and Integration Plan
- Attach this document to the original master cipher document that started the thread.  
- Add a short change log at the top of the master document pointing to this file as "Understanding Desired Output 1.0."  
- Future updates will be appended as incremental versions (1.1, 1.2, etc.) with date and summary lines.

---

### Next Steps and Recommended Actions
- Embed the final persona description into the V5 style box used for generation.  
- Run a bar-count audit per section if you want exact 8/16 bar enforcement for studio stems.  
- Save a copy of the current generated track and label it with this document version for traceability.  
- If desired, I can produce a cue-sheet-ready export (bar counts per section and suggested loop points) or regenerate the entire chapter with updated sonic meditator descriptors.

### Versioning and Ownership
- **Document name:** Understanding Desired Output 1.0  
- **Owner:** Jacob  
- **Status:** Approved draft to be updated as project evolves


**Crafting the Master Metadata Document**

Okay, the user wants me to write this into a document that will attach to a master prompt. I should follow the formatting rules—probably with headings and such. No need to ask for clarification, just make it concise with the necessary sections.  

I’ll create the "Master Metadata Document — Song Metadata Standard," dividing it into sections like purpose, metadata template, vocabulary lists (like theory, groove, voice, etc.), narration rules, and examples (good and bad). I’ll mention the single bracket rule and enforcement. Ready to go!
### Master Metadata Document — Song Metadata Standard

Purpose  
Define a single authoritative metadata standard for scripture-to-song outputs. Enforce one-bracket-per-section explicit metadata, a normalized vocabulary, and production rules so LLMs and downstream generators produce consistent, repeatable results.

---

### Top-level song header (one bracket pair only)
[studio: <studio name or neutral preset>; genre: <genre>; persona info: <none|persona>; default meter: <4/4>; stylebox: <stylebox tokens>; no_tape_hiss|allow_vinyl_crackle; production_notes: <short free-text only>; key: <key>; bpm: <BPM>]

Rules
- Appears once at the top of each song file.  
- Free-text limited to production_notes only; avoid informal qualifiers elsewhere.  
- Studio may be a respected studio name or a neutral preset; do not invent local shorthands that imply generator presets unless mapped in the mapping layer.

---

### Section metadata (single-bracket explicit metadata rule)
All metadata for a section must be inside one bracket pair at the start of the section. The first field MUST be the section_label.

[section_label: <Intro|Narration1|V1|V2|Hook1|Bridge|Outro>; voice: <raw_flow|spoken|theatric_deep|sing_vocal|choral|elder_speaker>; bars: min–max; tempo: <BPM>; key: <Key>; theory: <controlled_theory_token>; groove: <descriptor>; cadence: 1|3; insert_anchor: <kick|snare|kick_on_1_snare_on_3|sub_swell|low_bass_hum>; loop_friendly: yes|no; sonic: <primary;secondary;fx>; fx: <short list>; persona info: none; stylebox: <stylebox tokens>]

Required fields
- section_label (first)  
- voice (defaults to raw_flow if omitted but must be explicit in files)  
- bars  
- tempo or inherit from song top if not provided  
- sonic (must include primary;secondary;fx)

Prohibitions
- No extra bracket pairs for the same section.  
- No informal placeholders like hint, token, ish. Use the phrasing “explicit metadata information within the brackets” instead.  
- No production free-text inside section metadata; production_notes only at song top.

Examples
- Correct:
  [V2: voice: raw_flow; bars: 10–16; tempo: 78; key: A minor; theory: dorian; groove: half_time_groove; cadence: 3; insert_anchor: kick_on_1_snare_on_3; loop_friendly: yes; sonic: warm_rhodes;tight_snare;ambient_echo; persona info: none; stylebox: early90s_gritty;no_tape_hiss]  
- Incorrect:
  [V2: verses 6–13; tempo: 78; theory: dorian_hint; groove: half_time_groove] (verse-range omitted at song-level; hint present; multiple bracket pairs are used elsewhere)

---

### Narration rules (scene-setter logic)
- Use Narration sections where the KJV text supplies scene-setting or stage direction (e.g., “And seeing the multitudes…”, “And it came to pass…”).  
- Section label format: Narration1, Narration2, etc. Narration always precedes the musical section that follows.  
- Default voice for narration: theatric_deep or spoken depending on the file; include an insert_anchor such as low_bass_hum and a short sonic cue (ambient_swell, tape_amp, cinematic_swell).  
- Keep narration short (1–4 lines) unless explicitly requested as extended spoken-song.

Example
[Narration1: voice: theatric_deep; bars: 2–4; tempo: 86; key: A minor; theory: none; groove: spoken_pulse; cadence: 1; insert_anchor: low_bass_hum; loop_friendly: yes; sonic: low_bass_hum;ambient_swell;fx: subtle_vinyl_crackle; persona info: none; stylebox: early90s_gritty;no_tape_hiss]

---

### Controlled vocabulary (canonical lists — extend by change request only)
Theory (examples): dorian; major_pedal; minor_pedal; iv-V-I_motion; lift_to_coda; call-response; modal_pedal; chant_overlap  
Groove: slow_boom_bap; mid_boom_bap; half_time_groove; steady_groove; upbeat_groove; ethereal_uplift; spoken_pulse; laidback_groove  
Voice: raw_flow; spoken; theatric_deep; sing_vocal; choral; elder_speaker  
Stylebox tokens: early90s_gritty; no_tape_hiss; allow_vinyl_crackle; modern_crisp; cinematic_large_room  
Insert anchors: kick; snare; kick_on_1_snare_on_3; sub_swell; low_bass_hum; snare_lead; kick_with_sub_drop  
Sonic fields: primary;secondary;fx (examples) — low_sub; warm_pad; warm_rhodes; tight_snare; airy_falsetto; organ_pad; cinematic_brass; ambient_echo; vinyl_crackle_light  
Cadence: 1 or 3 (explicit numeric)  
Loop_friendly: yes or no

Vocabulary change process
- All additions must come through a documented change request with examples and mapping tests.

---

### Song-level rules and verse-range tracking
- Verse ranges (e.g., verses 1–17) are tracked only at the song-level header, not inside section metadata.  
- Song-level header contains the canonical verse range if desired: add verses: 1–17 in the top bracket.  
- Sections reference bars and should be split so bar counts match the studio arrangement.

---

### Enforcement and automation (recommended)
- Add a metadata linter to validate:
  - One bracket pair per section at start only.  
  - Required fields present.  
  - Controlled vocabulary only.  
  - No forbidden words (hint, token, ish, etc.).  
- Integrate linter into pre-commit/CI so malformed files are rejected.  
- Provide a one-click template generator and a one-page cheat sheet for contributors.

---

### Examples (copy-paste ready)

Song top example:
[studio: Clear Track Studios, Clearwater FL; genre: gospel_hiphop; persona info: none; default meter: 4/4; stylebox: early90s_gritty; no_tape_hiss; production_notes: high-fidelity; Dolby Atmos; key: A minor; bpm: 86; verses: 1–17]

Narration + section example:
[Narration1: voice: theatric_deep; bars: 2–4; tempo: 86; key: A minor; theory: none; groove: spoken_pulse; cadence: 1; insert_anchor: low_bass_hum; loop_friendly: yes; sonic: low_bass_hum;ambient_swell;fx: subtle_vinyl_crackle; persona info: none; stylebox: early90s_gritty;no_tape_hiss]  
And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:  
And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,

[V1: voice: raw_flow; bars: 8–12; tempo: 72; key: A minor; theory: minor_pedal; groove: slow_boom_bap; cadence: 1; insert_anchor: kick; loop_friendly: yes; sonic: low_sub;warm_pad;fx: subtle_ambience; persona info: none; stylebox: early90s_gritty;no_tape_hiss]  
Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.  
Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.

# The Suno Architect's Blueprint: Complete Guide

## **CORE PHILOSOPHY**
- Treat your prompt as an architectural blueprint
- Consistency in metadata tags = predictability in output
- Primary control levers: [Studio], [Genre], and section-specific tags

PART 1: THE FOUNDATION**

### **Studio & Genre Prompt**
*Place in main "Style" or "Prompt" box*

**Format:**
[Studio Name] [Genre, Subgenre, Tempo (if fixed), Key Descriptors]

**Examples:**
- [Southern Lord Studios] [doom metal, sludge, 55 BPM, crushing riffs, growled vocals]
- [D&D Studios] [underground hip-hop, dark trap, heavy 808s, gritty rap flow]
- [Abbey Road Studios] [orchestral rock, epic, cinematic strings, male vocals]

**Rules:**
- Use lowercase for all except proper nouns (USA, UK)
- Apply global BPM here only if tempo is constant throughout
- Studio tag invokes specific sonic signatures

### **Lyrics Metadata Header**
*Place at top of Lyrics box*

**For Songs with Vocals:**
[Produced by Producer A and Producer B]
[Recorded at Studio Name and Another Studio]
[hyper-modern production with clear vocals, no autotune, Dolby Atmos mix, high-fidelity]

**For Instrumentals:**
[Produced by Producer A and Producer B]
[Recorded at Studio Name]
[hyper-modern production, Dolby Atmos mix, high-fidelity]
[Instrumental]

PART 2: SONG SECTIONS & INSTRUMENTATION**

- Acts as a creative director for the entire generation
- Has profound impact on musical style and arrangement choices
- gives fine details to suno ai 
### **Format:**
One majestic, evocative sentence describing the song's core essence, or highlighting a particular aspect.

### **Examples:**
a desperate escape through a dying star system, where pulsing synth arpeggios race against collapsing time signatures and a desperate vocal pleads for redemption, chants & Breakdown contrast
