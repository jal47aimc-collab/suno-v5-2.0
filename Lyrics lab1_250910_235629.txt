🎤 Lyrics Generation Project
⚙️ Option Settings
🎚️ Sliding Scale Options (0–100)
(Defaults can be set later — these are adjustable per project)
• Twist Loop Scale → linear vs. modular structure
• Infighting Scale → 0 = none, 100 = hostile battle stances
• Swearing Scale → profanity intensity
• Token Density Scale → lyrical word complexity (randomized per section, or patterned across a whole song)
• Imagery Scale → plain → surreal/metaphorical
• Violence Scale → none → gore/brutality
• Darkness Scale → neutral → doom/occult/apocalyptic
• Complex Rhyme Scale → simple end-rhymes → multi-syllabic webs
• Melody vs. Rhythm Scale → chant-like → highly melodic phrasing
• Speed Scale → slow crawl → hyperspeed (rap doubletime / blast-beats)
• Repetition Scale → minimal repeat → heavy hooks/mantras
• Emotion Scale → flat/detached → raw rage/sorrow
• Obscurity Scale → clear meaning → fully coded/abstract
• Harshness Scale → clean delivery → guttural/growl/scream
• Spiritual Weight Scale → secular/raw → biblical/theological
• Theatrical Scale → stripped raw → operatic / over-the-top
• Groove Scale → rigid/straight → swung/loose feel
• Atmosphere Scale → dry/direct → drenched in reverb & space
• Wordplay Scale → straightforward → pun-heavy / layered doubles
• Energy Scale → mellow → all-out chaos
⏻ On/Off Switch Options
(Flip features on/off per project or per section)
• 90s Reference (Hip-Hop only)
• Infighting (yes/no, overrides scale if needed)
• Parentheses Voice (allow secondary voice artifacts, unpredictable)
• Notation Hacks Active (asterisks, ellipses, caps, phonetics)
• Archaic Vocabulary (biblical/old diction)
• Sound FX Words (boom, clap, scratch)
• Call & Response (built-in echo/chant)
• Genre Blend Mode (rap + metal/rock fusion, but no extreme rap-metal blends; limited to hard rock + metal blending)
• Explicit Storytelling (linear narrative vs. abstract mode)
• Chant Mode (short repeated lines, crowd feel → includes Burstmetal style definition placeholder)
• Freestyle Mode (looser structure, rawer lines → handled as a sliding scale, default 25% chance per verse)
• Build/Drop Dynamics (energy rises/drops triggered)
• Multi-Section Echoes (repeated motifs across sections)
• Archetype Mode (character voice, e.g. prophet/warrior/demon)
• Atmospheric Layering (background hums, drones, textures)
• Punchline Emphasis (highlight final words of bars)
• Narrator Voice (omniscient, storyteller mode)
• Backmasking Hints (cryptic phrases, reversed feel)
• Silence Breaks (intentional pauses, dead stops)
• Crowd Shout FX (“yeah!”, “woah!”, “fight!”)

1. Structure Tags
Use square brackets [ ] to guide the AI:
• [Intro]
• [Verse 1]
• [Pre-chorus]
• [Chorus/Drop]
• [Verse 2]
• [Bridge]
• [Outro]
• [Fade Out]
• [Instrumental] (guitar, piano, sax, bpm)
• Special forms (with definitions):
  - [Ostinato] = a short musical/lyrical phrase repeated throughout.
  - [Motif] = a recurring idea or lyrical image.
  - [Hook] = the main catchy line or musical idea.
  - [Exposition] = section that introduces theme or scene.
  - [Development] = variation/expansion of an introduced theme.
  - [Transition] = connective passage between sections.
  - [Refrain] = short repeated phrase (mini-chorus that returns after verses).
  - [Coda] = closing “tail” that wraps the song after the last section.
  - [Tag] = a short repeated ending line/phrase for emphasis.
  - [Crescendo] = a section that builds gradually in intensity.
  - [Tutti] = full-force moment where everything hits together (all-in).
👉 Rule: Only one voice per section. Parentheses ( ) may sometimes act as second voice, but results are unpredictable.
👉 Tip: Works best with 2 or 4-line blocks (or multiples of 4).

2. Vocal Styling
• Genres specified directly (underground rap, doom metal, hard rock, metalcore, etc.).
• Single voice per section only. No multi-voice stacking.

3. Word Shaping
• Vowel-stretching: goo-o-o-odbye → elongated syllables
• ALL CAPS + ! or ?: louder/urgent delivery
• Brackets [ ]: structural/effect directions
• Parentheses ( ) = optional backing/aside (unpredictable)

4. Dynamics & Effects
• [Pianissimo] = quiet/soft
• [Fortissimo] = loud/max energy
• [Quiet] / [Loud] = simple dynamic hints
• [Build] / [Drop] = tension/release cues
• Inline FX: *gunshots, *claps, *explosions, *scratch, *breath

5. Lyric Writing Workflow
• Modular blocks instead of strict linear flow.
• Twist Loop = write sections as modular blocks; they can be mixed, re-ordered, or looped to create variety without rewriting. Useful for modular rap cyphers and for reshaping metal/hard-rock sections.
