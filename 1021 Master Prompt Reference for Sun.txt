### Master Prompt Reference for Suno AI Music Maker V5 — KJV Edition

This document is the single source of truth for generating modular, scripture-based text prompts for Suno AI Music Maker V5. All lyrical content must be verbatim King James Version (KJV) unless the user explicitly authorizes an override. The document defines canonical syntax, controlled vocabularies, persona rules, validation and parsing checks, workflow for chapter→song requests, QA/regression practices, export mapping for studio cue sheets, and edge-case policies.

---

### Top-Level Metadata Block

#### Purpose and format
- Appears once at the top of every prompt.
- Single bracketed block; semicolon-separated key:value pairs.
- Required keys: **studio**, **genre**, **version**.
- Recommended keys: **persona**, **voice**, **mood**, **delivery**, **groove**, **fx**, **sonic**, **theory**, **rhyme**, **emotion**, **spiritual_weight**, **narrationX**.

Example:
```markdown
[studio: Clear Track Studios; genre: scripture cipher; persona: jal_the_messenger; voice: chant; mood: reverent; delivery: solemn; groove: slow_sway; fx: ambient_pad + lo-fi_eq; sonic: organ,subdrone; theory: Mixolydian; rhyme: none; emotion: serene; spiritual_weight: high; narrationX: false; version: V5.2]
```

Rules:
- Use lower-case keys and concise tokens.
- No nested brackets or markdown headers inside the top block.
- Top-level defaults may be overridden by section blocks.

---

### Canonical Section Format

#### Pattern
- Each section is a single bracketed block followed immediately by KJV lyric lines (or blank for instrumental).
- Section label must be the first token inside the bracket; abbreviations preferred (v1, v2, intro, hook, bridge, outro, interlude, prehook).
- Use `voice:raw` inside section blocks for compactness.

Canonical pattern:
```markdown
[<section_label>: voice:raw; tempo: <bpm>; fx: <fx_chain>; stylebox: <style_category>; sonic: <instrumentation>; theory: <mode>; bars: <n>; groove: <groove>]
<KJV lyrics or blank>
```

Ordering and repetition:
- Sections may be ordered, repeated, or omitted.
- Lyrics must be exact KJV lines unless an explicit override token is present in the top block.
- No markdown headers or stray text outside brackets that can be interpreted as lyrics.

Example:
```markdown
[v2: voice:raw; tempo: 82bpm; fx: analog_warmth + gospel_organ; stylebox: scripture_cipher; sonic: organ,subdrone; theory: Aeolian; bars: 8; groove: slow_swing]
This is a faithful saying,
and these things I will that thou affirm constantly,
that they which have believed in God
might be careful to maintain good works.
```

---

### Validation Rules and Parsing Safety Tests (Automated Checks)

Run for every generated prompt. Report pass/fail with details.

#### Syntax parser checks
- Balanced bracket presence for top-level and each section.
- Section label is first token in section block.
- Semicolon-separated key:value pairs only; keys in canonical order inside sections: section_label → voice:raw → tempo → fx → stylebox → sonic → theory → bars → groove.
- No markdown headers or stray hashtags outside brackets.

#### Lyric verification
- Exact-match check for every lyric line against KJV corpus.
- Report verse references for each matched line and any mismatches with suggested corrections.
- Enforce user authorization token for any non-KJV lyrics.

#### FX and sonic validation
- Fail on any disallowed noise token.
- Confirm fx combinations against allowed-pair matrix.
- Sonic field must only contain tokens from sonic library.

#### Structural and edge validators
- Check bars are integer and tempos numeric bpm.
- Flag empty lyric blocks (instrumental) as intentional only if bars or narrationX indicates intent.
- Flag verses exceeding N words (configurable; default N=35) as compression candidates.
- Detect parentheses, em dashes, colons, semicolons and flag as delivery-impact items.

#### Output normalization
- Trim trailing whitespace, normalize punctuation spacing, collapse duplicate semicolons, normalize token separators.

Validation summary must be included immediately after generation (short checklist).

---

### Workflow: Chapter→Song (two-step: Analysis then Generation)

#### 1. Request intake
- User supplies: book, chapter, optional verses, explicit overrides (tempo, persona, stylebox, lyrics_override).
- Assistant confirms request and restates overrides.

#### 2. Statistical Analysis of Approach (first substantive response)
Assistant generates an analyst-style summary only (no lyrics). Content:
- Length metrics: total verses; total words; avg words/verse; longest verse length.
- Density metrics: % imperative sentences; direct speech count; proper noun count; coord clause count.
- Musical suitability metrics: estimated lyric lines per 16-bar verse; recommended bars per section; suggested bpm range.
- Structural suggestion: recommended section breakdown with verse→section mapping.
- Delivery-impact flags: parenthetical content; em dashes; colons; semicolons.
- Risk flags: long verses, quoted dialogue, archaic punctuation.
- Confidence score (0–100) for direct mapping to song without compression.
- Noteworthy list: parentheticals (verses and content); direct speech verses; flagged tokens from Flagged Terms Library.

No lyrics or generation at this stage.

#### 3. User directives or approval
- User responds with directives (e.g., compress v3 into 8 bars, whispered aside for parentheses) or "go" to proceed as recommended.
- If no reply, assistant waits; do not auto-proceed.

#### 4. Generation (only after user approval)
Assistant produces:
- Top-level metadata block.
- Bracketed section blocks with voice:raw and canonical fields.
- KJV-only lyrics verbatim (unless authorized override present).
- Inline validation summary: syntax pass/fail; KJV-match OK/FAIL counts; disallowed FX present? Y/N.
- Export mapping for studio cue sheets (textual).
- QA checklist results.

Then assistant stops and awaits user feedback.

---

### QA Checklist, Regression Testing Corpus, and Version Governance

#### QA Checklist (applied to each generated prompt)
- Top-level block present and valid.
- Section labels inside brackets and abbreviated.
- voice:raw used in section blocks where applicable.
- KJV-only lyrics verified (or override token present).
- Disallowed FX absent.
- Field order correct in section blocks.
- Parsable by Suno V5 (syntax checks passed).

#### Regression Test Corpus (seed list)
- Psalm 1; Psalm 23; Proverbs 3; Titus 3; 2 John; Philemon; Jude; 1 Thessalonians 5; Colossians 3; John 11 (shorter sections); plus 10 additional short chapters drawn from Psalms, Proverbs, and epistles (total 20).
- Run template or library changes against corpus; log failures.

#### Versioning and Changelog Policy
- Base version token: V5.2.
- Minor change (typo, example edits) → bump patch: V5.2.1.
- Library additions or token renames → minor bump: V5.3.
- Syntax or validation rule changes → major bump: V6.0.
- Changelog entry must include: date, version, summary, affected tokens/rules, regression results, migration note.

Contribution workflow:
- Propose token or rule change in a PR-like text block; provide tests against regression corpus; approval requires two collaborator signoffs.

---

### Export Mapping for Studio Cue Sheets and Session Presets (textual)

For each generated prompt assistant provides a non-file textual mapping:

- Track list mapping (section → stems):
  - e.g., v1 → lead_vocals, organ, subdrone, choir_pad
  - hook → lead_vocals, choir_lead, synthwash, subdrone
- Time estimates:
  - bars → seconds conversion at specified bpm (seconds ≈ bars * 60 / (bpm/4))
  - include approximate section durations.
- Mix notes (text):
  - Lead vocals: presence in 0–3 kHz; slight de-essing; reverb_tail 12–18% wet.
  - Organ: low-pass at 6 kHz; insert chorus_layer on hooks.
  - Subdrone: high-pass at 40 Hz; low-cut 30 Hz.
- Cue labels:
  - Canonical IDs e.g., CT01_v1, CT01_hook, CT01_outro.
- Stem priorities:
  - Vocals > organ > choir > subdrone > synthwash.
- Session preset suggestions (text only):
  - BPM, tempo map suggestions, recommended master bus processing keywords (light_compression, warm_eq).

---

### Edge-Case Policies

- Instrumental-only sections:
  - Allowed. Use empty lyric block and specify bars; set narrationX true/false per intention.
- Multi-verse compression:
  - Allowed only with explicit directive. Compression options are presented in analysis with exact verse groupings and target bars.
- Parenthetical content:
  - Always flagged in analysis; default handling is include verbatim with suggested delivery (whisper/aside). Final decision by user.
- Quoted dialogue:
  - Flagged in analysis; recommended delivery changes (spoken, whisper, conversational). User decides.
- Long verse handling:
  - Verses > N words flagged; options: split across sections, compress (requires override), or map to extended bars.
- Punctuation and archaic tokens:
  - Flagged for phonetic handling; user may request phonetic hints or persona adjustments.

### Examples and Bad-Example Fixes (brief)

Good section block:
```markdown
[v1: voice:raw; tempo: 78bpm; fx: ambient_pad; stylebox: cinematic; sonic: organ; theory: Mixolydian; bars: 4; groove: slow_sway]
The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures
He leadeth me beside the still waters
He restoreth my soul
```

Bad (will be rejected by parser):
- Using markdown header for section: `## v1` (treated as lyric)
- Including disallowed noise FX: `fx: vinyl_crackle`
- Placing section label outside bracket

---

### Implementation Checklist (for immediate adoption)

- Adopt canonical token libraries above.
- Implement syntax parser enforcing field orders and disallowed tokens.
- Seed regression test corpus and run baseline tests.
- Use the chapter→song workflow strictly: Analysis → User directive → Generation → Validation → Export mapping.

- Maintain changelog and bump version per governance rules.

Updates.
• 	Bracket format: single-line top-level metadata; single-line section headers; lyrics placed outside brackets.
• 	Delimiters: commas used for lists, semicolons preserved inside KJV lines only.
• 	Source: all Bible text pulled only from King James Bible Online link included in metadata.

### Session update for master prompt reference

Summary of scope and purpose  
- Produce studio-ready song prompts that use KJV scripture verbatim, include bracketed metadata headers per song section, and fit within a strict character limit for model ingestion.  
- Metadata and lyrics together define the final prompt whose exact character count governs whether a chapter stays single-song or is split into sequential songs.

---

### Fixed formatting rules to apply going forward

- Use a single bracketed metadata header per section with this minimal pattern:  
  [sectionRole: voice: sonic; instrumentation]  
- Do not use underscores, pipes, or invented tokens. Use single words or space-separated phrases inside metadata (e.g., close lead vocal; slight tape warmth).  
- Place KJV lines verbatim immediately after the bracket header, one KJV line per physical line. No extra text, annotations, or added words inside lyric lines.  
- Top-level blocks allowed: [studio: ...] and [subgenre: ...] when needed; these count toward total characters.  
- No persona tags, ad-hoc shorthand, or non‑document tokens unless present in the master prompt reference.

---

### Character-count and splitting logic

- Final-prompt character count = every character in the exact text to be sent (all brackets, colons, semicolons, spaces, newlines, and KJV lines).  
- Threshold: ≤ 5000 characters → single song output. > 5000 → split chapter into sequential songs labeled first song section, second song section, etc., and recompute counts per resulting prompt so each segment ≤ 5000.  
- Always compute and return the exact total after producing the formatted prompt text.

---

### Song-section semantics and minimal vocab

- Required sectionRole values to use explicitly when applicable: intro, V1, V2, chorus, bridge, hook, outro, first song section, second song section, etc.  
- Each section header must be human- and machine-parseable: sectionRole appears first, then voice, then sonic, then instrumentation separated by a semicolon. Example:  
  [V1: close lead vocal: slight tape warmth; upright bass]  
- If a section has no lyrics, include the header alone (no blank-line lyric placeholder). If it has lyrics, place them immediately following the header.

---

### Validation and compatibility checks

- To validate downstream model parsing, provide a one-shot test prompt that asks the target model to parse a single bracket header and return a minimal JSON object. Use the simplified header pattern above.  
- If downstream fails, produce a preprocessor that converts our headers to the model’s accepted format; record that conversion mapping in the master prompt reference.  
- Always include the exact formatted prompt plus the exact character count so compatibility can be rerun deterministically.

---

### Deliverables to attach to the master prompt reference

- The canonical header pattern and example for each sectionRole (compact list).  
- Character-count algorithm (exact: include newlines as characters) with one worked example using a short chapter.  
- Split logic rules and labeling convention for multi-song chapters.  
- Validation test prompt (single header → JSON) and expected JSON schema.  
- Style prohibitions: no underscores; no pipes; no invented persona tokens; no added scripture text; no inline commentary in outputs.

---

### Next use instructions (how I will behave in new sessions)

- I will generate only the canonical bracket headers and KJV lines verbatim, formatted exactly as specified.  
- I will compute and return the exact character count for the complete prompt and split if necessary.  
- I will not invent formatting, tokens, or separators not documented here.  
- I will include the validation test when requested to confirm downstream parsing.

---

End of update.

### Document update summary

This update captures the session decisions, parsing logic, generation constraints, and operational tokens to attach to the Master Prompt Reference source document.

---

### Core workflow rules
- Two-step process: Analysis pass first producing statistics, section mapping, and risk flags; wait for explicit user approval (Go) before Generation.  
- Generation produces a parser-ready prompt only after approval and includes the top-level block, section headers, exact KJV lines (one printed-KJV line per physical prompt line), verification mapping, export mapping, QA checklist, and exact character counts.  
- Narrative inserts or any non-KJV content are permitted only when the on off switch labeled **lyrics_override** is set to true and an **override_reason** is provided.  
- Forced changes to canonical KJV lineation or splitting verses across prompt physical lines are permitted only when the on off switch labeled **split_authorization** is set to true; otherwise such changes are flagged and blocked.

---

### Validation and parser rules
- Per-line rule: each physical lyric line in KJV sections must exact-match the canonical printed‑KJV source; no visible verse numerals in lyrics.  
- Verification output must map every physical prompt line to its canonical verse reference and list flags: KJV_EXACT, NON_KJV, PARENTHESIS, CROSS_REF, SPLIT_MISMATCH.  
- Parentheses in lyric text must be detected and flagged as PARENTHESIS and verified against canonical source lineation.  
- Cross-reference detection must run a match pass against the KJV corpus and surface CROSS_REF warnings (e.g., Genesis 1:1 → John 1 tie).  
- FX, persona, voice, groove, sonic tokens must be validated against the canonical token libraries; disallowed tokens cause validation failure.

---

### Character-count and split logic
- Exact character count includes every character: brackets, colons, semicolons, spaces, newlines, and all KJV text.  
- Threshold: ≤ 5000 characters → single song allowed; > 5000 → automatically generate a split plan into sequential songs where each segment ≤ 5000 and recompute counts per segment.  
- The Generation output must include the exact total and the final split decision.

---

### Export mapping and studio deliverables
- Provide track→section mapping, bar→seconds conversion using seconds ≈ bars * 60 / (bpm/4), approximate section durations, stem priorities, mix notes, and suggested session presets as text only.  
- Document any musical splits or mappings where canonical prompt lines are grouped into musical phrases, annotated as musical_split entries in export mapping while preserving literal prompt lineation unless split_authorization is true.

---

### Implementation notes and examples
- Verse numerals must be omitted from lyric lines; verse-to-line references appear only in verification mapping.  
- Narrative sections must be separate section headers (e.g., narrative1) and explicitly require lyrics_override:true.  
- Provide one short example in the source doc showing a top-level block, a narrative section, a hook section of three KJV lines (no verse numbers in lyrics), and the corresponding verification mapping.  
- Add explicit guidance: treat Boolean toggles as on off switches; list default on off states used in prior examples (lyrics_override:false; split_authorization:false) and how changing them changes validation behavior.

---

Next step: append this update statement to the Master Prompt Reference file and, when you confirm, I will generate a concise example block for direct insertion into the document.



### Update: Readiness and Generation gating for Analysis → Generation workflow

Summary  
- Add a mandatory readiness gate before accepting a user "go" for Generation. The system will only prompt the user to reply “go” when all preconditions are satisfied and any blocking issues are clearly listed.

---

### Preconditions that must be satisfied before presenting “go”
- **KJV verification available**: canonical KJV text for the chapter is present and matches the expected source.  
- **Character-count threshold defined**: maximum prompt character limit is specified in the document or defaulted.  
- **Split policy set**: split_authorization true/false must be explicit or defaulted.  
- **Persona and style parameters set**: persona, BPM range, and stylebox must be declared or defaulted.  
- **Validation rules present**: required validation checks (bracket syntax, disallowed FX, field order) must be declared.

---

### Readiness messaging (text to display when ready)
- **READINESS OK — READY FOR GENERATION**  
- Followed by one-line summary of automatic checks that will run on Generation: **Checks: KJV-exact; character-count; bracket-syntax; split-threshold; disallowed-FX.**

---

### Blocking-message template (text to display when not ready)
- **NOT READY — GENERATION BLOCKED**  
- Followed by a short bullet list of unresolved issues from the preconditions, each with an action item:
  - **Missing KJV source** — attach canonical KJV text or confirm source.  
  - **Missing character limit** — set max characters for prompts.  
  - **Split policy unspecified** — set split_authorization true or false.  
  - **Persona/style unspecified** — choose persona, BPM, stylebox.  
  - **Validation rules absent** — include validation checklist.

---

### Generation behavior changes
- If **READINESS OK**, the user prompt asking for “go” appears and the assistant will proceed to Generation immediately when the user replies “go.”  
- If **NOT READY**, the assistant will not accept “go” and will instead display the blocking-message template; the assistant will require the user to resolve the listed items or explicitly override them before Generation can start.  
- Any automatic compression or splitting performed during Generation will be **logged inline** and the log will be included in the validation summary.

---

### Logging and transparency
- Every Generation attempt will produce a short header in the output with: **Readiness status; list of checks run; any compressions applied; exact character counts; split decision**.  
- Keep the readiness state and last blocking-items at the top of the source document for quick review.

---

### Version note
- **Change log entry:** "Readiness gating and blocking messages added to Analysis→Generation workflow; explicit preconditions and messaging templates included."  
- **Version:** update +1 to the master prompt reference version number where you track revisions.



### Experience log for John chapter 1 → Suno V5 workflow

#### Context
- **Project:** Convert KJV John chapter 1 into Suno V5–ready song prompts for studio production.  
- **User:** Jacob (Hudson, FL); requested literal KJV preservation, modular/parsable Suno prompts, and workflow control.  
- **Scope requested:** Two-song generation (default chosen by assistant), verse-level analysis, and final Suno prompts.  

---

#### Timeline of key interactions
- User provided a link to the Master Prompt Reference and asked for a plan to convert John 1 into one or multiple songs.  
- Assistant proposed a two-step workflow (Analysis first, Generation only after explicit “go”) and listed Analysis deliverables.  
- User replied “go.” Assistant ran an Analysis pass and returned a structural plan, section mapping, risks, and recommended defaults.  
- User confirmed “go” again expecting Generation; assistant asked for explicit “proceed” to produce verse-level table.  
- User clarified expectation: when they say “go ahead and generate,” unspecified options should be chosen by the assistant. Assistant accepted and agreed to use sensible defaults and document discretionary choices.  
- User said they did not want a decision log by default; assistant acknowledged and agreed to stop including it unless requested.  
- User then explicitly requested: “Produce a log documenting this experience” to attach to the master reference document.

---

#### Decisions made by the assistant (defaults used unless overridden)
- **Song split chosen:** Two songs (Song A: vv.1–14; Song B: vv.15–51).  
- **KJV handling:** Preserve verbatim KJV text by default; compression only with explicit user approval.  
- **Bar allocations:** Dense prologue and key verses assigned extended bars (24–32); most verses assigned 16–20 bars.  
- **BPM defaults:** Song A: 68–80; Song B: 88–100.  
- **Personas assigned:** jal_the_messenger for declarative verses; meditative_sage for hooks; community_chorus for theological refrains.  
- **Prompt-size management:** Will split prompts if character limits approached; default prompt char threshold: 5000.

---

#### Actions completed
- Performed chapter-level analysis: verse count (51), natural clusters, flagged high-density verses, and produced a recommended section mapping.  
- Produced recommendation to split into two songs with rationale and suggested musical/prompt defaults.  
- Prepared to generate Suno V5–ready prompts contingent on explicit user command.

---

#### Outstanding user choices (left for user override)
- Any compression of KJV text for flow.  
- Any change to the two-song split (one-song or three-song alternatives).  
- Final persona/BPM/bar overrides.  
- Whether to include a decision log with future generations.

---

#### Requested deliverable
- **This log** — to be attached to the bottom of the linked Master Prompt Reference as an update.

---

#### Suggested next steps (if you want me to act now)
- If you want the Suno V5 prompts generated now, reply: “go ahead and generate” and I will produce two prompt-ready outputs (Song A and Song B) containing verbatim KJV lines, persona tags, BPM, and bar allocations.  
- If you want the verse-level word-count table before generation, reply: “proceed with verse table” and I will produce it first.

---

#### Final note
- You asked for this log; I provided it and will not include decision logs in future outputs unless you explicitly request one.
