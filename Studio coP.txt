# The Suno Architect's Blueprint: Complete Guide

## **CORE PHILOSOPHY**
- Treat your prompt as an architectural blueprint
- Consistency in metadata tags = predictability in output
- Primary control levers: [Studio], [Genre], and section-specific tags

PART 1: THE FOUNDATION**

### **Studio & Genre Prompt**
*Place in main "Style" or "Prompt" box*

**Format:**

- [D&D Studios] [underground hip-hop, dark trap, heavy 808s, gritty rap flow]
- [Abbey Road Studios] [orchestral rock, epic, cinematic strings, male vocals]

**Rules:**
- Use lowercase for all except proper nouns (USA, UK)

The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble;  
The name of the God of Jacob defend thee;

But we are risen, and stand upright.

1. Structure Tags
Use square brackets [ ] to guide the AI:
‚Ä¢ [Intro]
‚Ä¢ [Verse 1]
‚Ä¢ [Pre-chorus]
‚Ä¢ [Chorus/Drop]
‚Ä¢ [Verse 2]
‚Ä¢ [Bridge]
‚Ä¢ [Outro]
‚Ä¢ [Fade Out]
‚Ä¢ [Instrumental] (guitar, piano, sax, bpm)
‚Ä¢ Special forms (with definitions):
¬† - [Ostinato] = a short musical/lyrical phrase repeated throughout.
¬† - [Motif] = a recurring idea or lyrical image.
¬† - [Hook] = the main catchy line or musical idea.
¬† - [Exposition] = section that introduces theme or scene.
¬† - [Development] = variation/expansion of an introduced theme.
¬† - [Transition] = connective passage between sections.
¬† - [Refrain] = short repeated phrase (mini-chorus that returns after verses).
¬† - [Coda] = closing ‚Äútail‚Äù that wraps the song after the last section.
¬† - [Tag] = a short repeated ending line/phrase for emphasis.
¬† - [Crescendo] = a section that builds gradually in intensity.
¬† - [Tutti] = full-force moment where everything hits together (all-in).
üëâ Rule: Only one voice per section. Parentheses ( ) may sometimes act as second voice, but results are unpredictable.
üëâ Tip: Works best with 2 or 4-line blocks (or multiples of 4).

2. Vocal Styling
‚Ä¢ Genres specified directly (underground rap, doom metal, hard rock, metalcore, etc.).
‚Ä¢ Single voice per section only. No multi-voice stacking.

3. Word Shaping
‚Ä¢ Vowel-stretching: goo-o-o-odbye ‚Üí elongated syllables
‚Ä¢ ALL CAPS + ! or ?: louder/urgent delivery
‚Ä¢ Brackets [ ]: structural/effect directions
‚Ä¢ Parentheses ( ) = optional backing/aside (unpredictable)

4. Dynamics & Effects
‚Ä¢ [Pianissimo] = quiet/soft
‚Ä¢ [Fortissimo] = loud/max energy
‚Ä¢ [Quiet] / [Loud] = simple dynamic hints
‚Ä¢ [Build] / [Drop] = tension/release cues
‚Ä¢ Inline FX: *gunshots, *claps, *explosions, *scratch, *breath

5. Lyric Writing Workflow
‚Ä¢ Modular blocks instead of strict linear flow.
‚Ä¢ Twist Loop = write sections as modular blocks; they can be mixed, re-ordered, or looped to create variety without rewriting. Useful for modular rap cyphers and for reshaping metal/hard-rock sections.

HOOK  
A chapter-specific chorus that sets the tone and theme

CIPHER  
Freestyle scripture overlays formatted for clarity and flow

COMMENTARY  
Intentional Infinite drops that support the message with precision

BRIDGE  
New Testament and Old Testament overlay using the two plus one system only

OUTRO  
Echo verse, prayer, or fade to close the chapter

Recurring Motifs

‚ÄúIn the beginning was the Word‚Äù  
Used as a foundational anchor in Chapter 1

Word Library: Flagged Terms for Studio Clarity  
For use in narration, cipher overlays, and AI voice synthesis

---

defileth  
- Archaic ‚Äú-eth‚Äù ending.  
- Pronounce as ‚Äúdefile-ith‚Äù with a soft ‚Äúth‚Äù (like ‚Äúwith,‚Äù not ‚Äúteeth‚Äù).  
- Common in Matthew 15 and John 15.  
- Tag for narration voice or phonetic cue.  
- Avoid cipher delivery unless stylized intentionally.

leaven  
- Often mispronounced or flattened in AI voice delivery.  
- Emphasize first syllable: ‚ÄúLEV-en.‚Äù  
- Appears in parables and doctrinal warnings.  
- Tag for clarity in cipher or overlay.  
- Consider commentary drop when used metaphorically.

---

Studio Strategy for Flagged Terms

- Assign narration voice for archaic or sensitive phrasing.  
- Use phonetic cues in scripts (e.g., ‚Äúdefile-ith‚Äù) to guide AI voice tools.  
- In CapCut overlays, you may modernize the text while keeping KJB audio intact.  
- Avoid spontaneous cipher use of flagged terms unless the flow supports it.  
- Infinite commentary should only highlight these words when contextually relevant.

---

Formatting Logic

- All flagged terms are tracked in this library for consistency.  
- Cue sheets will include a ‚ÄúFlagged Word‚Äù column for each chapter.  
- Words may be tagged as:  
  - Narration Only  
  - Phonetic Cue Required  
  - Commentary Eligible  
  - Overlay Sensitive

     Full of grace and truth  
     He came unto His own  
     (unto His own...)  

[ Narration 1: Ambient echo, Soft spoken ]  
In the beginning God created  
The heaven and the earth  
*  

[ Chorus 1: Unified voice, Ambient chant ]  
In the beginning was the Word  
And the Word was with God  
And the Word was God  
The same was in the beginning with God  
All things were made by him  
And without him was not any thing made that was made  
In him was life  
And the life was the light of men  
And the light shineth in darkness  
And the darkness comprehended it not  
*  

[ Narration 2: Deep voice, Bass hum ]  
There was a man sent from God  
Whose name was John  
*  

[ V1: Raw flow, Drums kick in, Theatrical swell ]  
The same came for a witness  
To bear witness of the Light  
That all men through him might believe  
He was not that Light  
But was sent to bear witness of that Light  
That was the true Light  
Which lighteth every man  
That cometh into the world  
He was in the world  
And the world was made by him  
And the world knew him not  
He came unto his own  
And his own received him not  
But as many as received him  
To them gave he power  
To become the sons of God  
Even to them that believe on his name  
Which were born, not of blood  
Nor of the will of the flesh  
Nor of the will of man  
But of God  
And the Word was made flesh  
And dwelt among us  
And we beheld his glory  
The glory as of the only begotten of the Father  
Full of grace and truth  
*  

[ Course 1 ]  

[ Narration 3: Infinite voice, Echo chamber ]  
John bare witness of him, and cried, saying,  
*  

[ V2: Cipher voice, Minimal percussion ]  
This was he of whom I spake  
He that cometh after me is preferred before me  
For he was before me  
And of his fulness have all we received  
And grace for grace  
For the law was given by Moses  
But grace and truth came by Jesus Christ  
No man hath seen God at any time  
The only begotten Son  
Which is in the bosom of the Father  
He hath declared him  
*  

[ Course 1 ]  

[ Narration 4: Infinite voice, Echo chamber ]  
And this is the record of John  
When the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him  
Who art thou?  
And he confessed  
*  

[ V3: Cipher voice, Raw cadence, Mid-tempo percussion ]  
And denied not  
But confessed, I am not the Christ  
And they asked him, What then?  
Art thou Elias?  
And he saith, I am not  
Art thou that prophet?  
And he answered, No  
Then said they unto him  
Who art thou?  
That we may give an answer to them that sent us  
What sayest thou of thyself?  
He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness  
Make straight the way of the Lord  
As said the prophet Esaias
